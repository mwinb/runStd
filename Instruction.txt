If on Windows add .exe to path
    Must have java stored in the path 
        https://javatutorial.net/set-java-home-windows-10
    Works in cmd prompt. Powershell does not seem to like stdlib.jar (but i dont care enough about windows to troubleshoot)
    Didn't work with script or by manually inputing on powershell.
    Just type cmd in powershell then runStd name.java (this works).
     
If on Linux/Mac store in bin "usr/local/bin" or "/usr/bin/
* Must have stdlib.jar inside folder with java file to be compiled.
run using:
    runStd fileName.java
The .java will be compiled using .:stdlib.jar or (windows) .;stdlib.jar.
After compiling the script will run the compiled version in terminal.
* on mac or linux may need to run "sudo chmod +x runStd" in order to run.
